About utility:
---------------
It is a powerful utility which enable users to replace strings in file or files.
It uses internally a Boyer Moore's Algorithm to search matched pattern in string (In Future, You can Add your Algorithm).
It has 4 option so far. (You can issue: replace --help to know about each option).
Its implementation based on ANSI C99 So, You can Port it easily on your desired processors.
It has been compiled using gcc version 4.9.2. However, You can use your compiler.
It released with a makefile to ease compilation, Configuration, and use your own IDE.
Is needs some modification which I promise to fix it in next versions. For example source code needs more comments 

Compilation:
------------
Compilation is so easy, Just run: make , then your executable will be ready to use.
It is an easy make file you edit it as you want.For example, you can specify install path suitable for your environment.
